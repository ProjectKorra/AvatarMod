Avatar Mod 2
============

This repository hosts the source code for the [Avatar Mod 2 project](http://av2.io), currently
developed by members of the ProjectKorra team. This project is a modification for Minecraft which
adds content from [*Avatar: The Last Airbender*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender).

The mod already has all four major types of bending; many unique, multipurpose Abilities; and mobs
and animals from the Avatar world. More information is available at the [wiki](http://projectkorra.wikia.com/wiki/Av2).
