Avatar Mod 2
============

Welcome to the AV2 Repository!
This repository stores the source code for the [Avatar Mod 2 project](https://avatar.amuzil.com/), currently
developed by members of the ProjectKorra team. This project is a modification for Minecraft which
adds content from [*Avatar: The Last Airbender*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender).

The mod currently has 4 Major Elements, 4 sub elements, and even more to come!
There are new mobs, multipurpose-abilities, items, etc all based on the TV show!!
More information is available at the [wiki](http://projectkorra.wikia.com/wiki/Av2).
