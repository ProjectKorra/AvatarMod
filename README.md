Avatar Mod 2
============
This repository hosts the source code for the [Avatar Mod 2 project](http://avatar.amuzil.com), currently
developed by members of the ProjectKorra team. This project is a modification for Minecraft which
adds content from [*Avatar: The Last Airbender*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender) and [*The Legend of Korra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Korra).

The mod already has all four major types of bending; many unique, multipurpose abilities; and mobs
and animals from the Avatar world. More information is available at the (incomplete) [wiki](https://projectkorra.wikia.com/wiki/Avatar_Mod_2).
