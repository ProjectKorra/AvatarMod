            <p>Lightningbending is a powerful Bending Style which deals large amounts of damage at the expense of Chi and defensive Abilities. Historically, it was used by Azula against Avatar Aang to nearly kill him. Therefore, it should be noted that lightningbending is not to be trifled with!</p>
            
            <p>If you happen to encounter a lightning bender, the lightning strike needs to be "charged" before use. This means the lightning bender is vulnerable for a few moments before firing the lightning. However, be careful as a single lightning strike can deal six hearts of damage plus fire damage.</p>
            
            <p>It is possible to block or redirect lightning away from yourself and onto a different target. This skill is rare and hard to master, but when learned properly it can prevent you from being killed by lightning benders.</p>
            
            <p>You can bending in Minecraft right now with <a href="http://av2.io">Avatar Mod 2</a>. Unfortunately, feature isn't available yet as it is still in development. The estimated release date is sometime around October 2017. Check back later for more information.</p>
